Bug/Refactor/Improvement List

- move default object to KTW service
- Determine which inputs are user inputs
- remove magic numbers
- create model for API request
- data model for user input is very vague
- CSS is in shambles, should be using nesting
- descriptions of inputs
	- on question mark click in "ZONE


User Input Overview: Portrait Mode

general layout:
five tabs labeled DRAW, GRID, WEAVE, KNIGHT, COLOR with icons each with a unique color
each tab (when opened) has a small question mark which displays help tooltip on
hover for that section of settings.

DRAW:
    desc - Holds groups of switches which turn on and off draw features described
        in the other tabs, this gives the user a chance to get an idea for which 
        settings do what.
    visual - animated toggle switches wrapped in colored zones coorsponding to
            tab colors.

GRID:

    size 
        desc - number of rows and columns of grid for knight to jump
        visual - dropdown with grid sizes and custom [w,h] field, includes warning
                 for slow load time when large grid sizes entered (64+), custom field
                 is populated on size select with selected value

        
    population
        desc - how each cell in the grid get its value, select a mode
        visual - dropdown with each option, ideally a preview an SVG grid

    trap count (image density)
        desc - how many iterations the knight goes on before the image is complete
        visual - radio buttons with low, medium, and high density, includes warning
                 on high for long generation wait time

WEAVE:

    width
        desc - the range of possible widths a weave-section* can take as well as
               how the weave-section widths change with time
        visual - four parallel sliders representing the following properties in order
                min width of weave-sections (sliding above max slider value disabled)
                max width of weave-sections (sliding above min slider value disabled)
                number of intermediate widths of weave-sections (discrete integer steps)
                osscilation frequency of width changes, (slow <-> fast)
                
    smooth
        desc - drawing styles for the weave
        visual - radio buttons         

KNIGHT: 
desc - settings having to deal with how the knight moves. It requires more user knowledge
       of the simulation.

    start point
        desc - where the knight begins its tour, and also where the knight returns to upon trap 
        visual - a text input field and a dropdown consisting of beginning, 
                 middle, end, random, custom, where custom is enterd by user in text input.
                 otherwise if any other dropdown value is selected, text input is read only.

    jump
        desc - shape of turns of the weave grid, can also determine size of holes. This parameter
               can currently break the API if jump size is wider than grid.
        visual - drop down of a x b coordinates as well as a text field for custom jump sizes

COLOR:

    domain
        desc - how fast the colors change per weave drawn, higher numbers means smoother colors
        visual - slider ranging from choppy to smooth with the value in a text box next to it
    
    background
        desc - what color the background is
        visual - colored square which brings up color picker modal including black, white, and all
                 colors of the currently selected color palette
    
    palette
        desc - currently color palette that is selected as well as a grid of every existing color palette
               palettes are selected and the name of the palette appears in a textbox
        visual - 3xN grid of color palette cells, each with five colored squares representing the palette,
                 row above grid has place for existing color palette and text area for color palette name




Roadmap for implementation

1. get tab nav pages setup with divs
